History of cli-twitter
v1.0 (24/09/2009)
* Added option for starting a gui version
  of clitter. Run it by writing in your
  terminal './clitter -g'. 
  *** NOTE *** For this to work you MUST
  have zenity on your system, otherwise
  the script will crash!
* Put the functions in a separate file for
  easier editing. File is functions.bash.
  Remember that you *NEED* this file and 
  that clitter will not work without it.

v0.2 (19/09/2009)
* Added log formatting
* Added sessions
* Added wget support for people that don't
  have cURL on their system

  to see if your tweet suceeded or not

* Basic cURL check
* Simple status update via Twitter API
